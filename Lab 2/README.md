# Lab 2

## Aim
Using Atmel AVR assembly language programming, implement external interrupts and timers in Atmel Atmega microprocessor. Aims of this experiment are:

- Generate an external (logical) hardware interrupt using an emulation of a push button switch.
- Write an ISR to switch ON an LED for a few seconds (10 secs) and then switch OFF. (The lighting of the LED could be verified by monitoring the signal to switch it ON).
- Use the 16 bit timer to make an LED blink with a duration of 1 second.
- Also, one needs to implement all of the above using C-interface.
