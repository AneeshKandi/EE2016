## Aim
Using C-interfacing, use C-programming, to implement the following tasks:
1. Read the status (binary position) of the switch and use the LEDs (8 LEDs are provided) to display the status of
each of the 8-bit DIP switch
2. Stepper motor control using Vi Microsystem's ViARM 7238 development board. Due to ongoing pandemic, only
emulated version of this experiment is intended here.

## Problem Statement

Following are the tasks we had done in the lab session:
### Problem 1
Write a program (in C) to dis-assemble a byte into two nibbles from the DIP switch states, multiply and display the
product in the LED.

### Problem 2
Write a program to control the stepper motor. Make it rotate in both the directions.

### Software used
Keil microvision 5
