# Lab 1

## Aim
Getting Started with AVR Assembly Programming in Microchip Studio

To implement basic arithmetic and logical manipulation programs using Atmel Atmega8 microcontroller in assembly
language simulation, including addition, multiplication, and comparison.

### Problem 1
Given two 8-bit binary words (byte), compute the sum and store it in register(s).

### Problem 2
Given two 16-bit binary words (byte), compute the sum and store it in register(s).

### Problem 3
Given two 8-bit binary words (byte), compute the product and store it in register(s).

### Problem 4
Given a finite set of binary words, load them from memory, identify the largest in the given set, and store this largest number in SRAM.
