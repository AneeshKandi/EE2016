## Aim

To 
- Learn the architecture of ARM processor 
- Learn basics of ARM instruction set, in particular the ARM instructions pertaining to computations 
- Go through example programs and (d) write assembly language programs for the given set of (computational) problems

## Problem Statement
Solve the following engineering problems using ARM through assembly programs
 
### Problem 1
Compute the factorial of a given number using ARM processor through assembly programming

### Problem 2
Combine the low four bits of each of the four consecutive bytes beginning at LIST into one 16-bit halfword. The value at LIST goes into the most signicant nibble of the result. Store the result in the 32-bit variable RESULT.

### Problem 3
Given a 32 bit number, identify whether it is an even or odd. (You implementation should not involve division).

### Software used
Keil uVision 5 IDE
